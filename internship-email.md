Hi ,

We could definitely consider an internship position - but, as I mentioned in the job posting, I'm looking for hopefully someone longer term, but I at the same time I have sooooo much stuff to do. I assume you are looking for a shorter term position for some reason?

What did you have in mind? Are you looking for part-time feature work? What's your expected hourly rate / compensation?

Do you have any web projects you can share or SaaS web experience?

Let me know about all this stuff and then hopefully we can schedule a call together and see what is possible!

Best,

Chris
