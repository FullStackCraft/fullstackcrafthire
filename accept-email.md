Dear ,

I really liked your application and a lot of the work you've done - I think some things we align on closely! You've made it through to the final round from a rather large pool of applicants. Let's schedule a video call to discuss the opportunity further and get to know each other better. Please schedule a time that works for you with my Calendly: https://calendly.com/fullstackcraft/30min

Best,

Chris
