Dear ,

Thanks a lot for your time and effort to apply to our Full Stack Developer position at Full Stack Craft. After careful consideration, we have decided to move forward with other candidates whose skills and experiences more closely align with our current needs. Trust me when I say as a solo guy posting a job on reddit I was amazed by the quality of applicants and all the cool projects you are all building. I know this sucks and the hiring process is harder than ever right now, so if it helps, this was my general triage process for all applicants:

- Does the applicant have a GitHub?
- Is their GitHub quite active with many repositories?
- Have they shipped full stack web applications?
- Do they have Go experience?
- Does it look like they have diverse experience in a variety of languages and technologies?

Some of these may seem unfair, but I'm just one guy trying to find the right partner to build with me. I hope you understand.

I've made an effort to reply to every single applicant - if there's one thing I hate (and know personally only too much) it's getting ghosted by a company after applying.

I've kept your information on file, and perhaps there will be further opportunities in the future. I wish you the best of luck in your job search and future endeavors.

Best,

Chris
