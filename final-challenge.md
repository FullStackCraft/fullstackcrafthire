I liked almost every interviewee I had! As a final fair challenge, as I mentioned may be likely, I'm going to give each candidate a PAID ($25) mini-feature to complete which should take around 4-6 hours. This will help me see how you code, communicate, and deliver on a real world task, and interact with the stack I use.

Thanks again for your efforts so far, I'm looking forward to seeing what you build!

Once you've finished your feature, I'd like the following thoughts from you:

- Is the feature well enough 'isolated' from the rest of the project (not too many cross dependencies, could be essentially activated and deactivated as needed)
- Is the solution well-typed and clean?
- What are risks / potential problems that could arise in the future from your implementation?
- What are the benefits of your solution vs. others? (If applicable, were there any other ways you considered implementing this feature?)
- What further improvements or ideas did you think of along the way?
