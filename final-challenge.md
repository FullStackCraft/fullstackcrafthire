Sorry for the delay! The last round of interviews just finished today.

As discussed, as a final fair challenge, I'm going to give you a PAID ($25) challenge to complete which should take around 6-8 hours (if you think this is unfair we can discuss). This will help me see how you code, communicate, and deliver on a real world task, and interact with the stack I use.

Thanks again for your efforts so far, I'm looking forward to seeing what you build!

Once you've finished your feature, I'd like the following thoughts from you:

- Is the feature well enough 'isolated' from the rest of the project (not too many cross dependencies, could be essentially activated and deactivated as needed)
- Is the solution well-typed and clean?
- What are risks / potential problems that could arise in the future from your implementation?
- What are the benefits of your solution vs. others? (If applicable, were there any other ways you considered implementing this feature?)
- What further improvements or ideas did you think of along the way?

For transparency, I've attached all four challenges that are being distributed to each candidate. I realize you may consider some are 'easier' than others, but certain folks have different strengths and weaknesses, and I want to give everyone a fair chance to show their skills.

You have challenge number [insert number / description here].

[other quick instructions here - adding to repo, etc.]

As you might tell, I've used Claude to probably over-spec the challenges, and the challenge overly mentions writing documentation - just ignore this - I'm more interested in the code and patterns - and do the best you can in the time allotted. Also please note these challenges are far more than I would expect in a single days work in normal work - this is a time-boxed challenge to see how you approach a problem, not completely full spec for a production ready system.

I should mention - not only are you allowed to use agentic / LLM / any resource, you are encouraged to do so!

For any questions, don't hesitate to reach out - I've probably forgotten something.

Good luck and I hope the challenge is fun!
