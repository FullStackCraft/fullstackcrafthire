# Full Stack Craft Hiring Process

Trust me when I say I _hate_ the standard hiring process for software engineers / developers / whatever in tech. I'm building this repo in broad daylight so everyone can see the process, and that I'm trying to make it fair as possible. Deny emails, acceptance emails, and even my interview script with potential candidates are all here for transparency.

Best,
