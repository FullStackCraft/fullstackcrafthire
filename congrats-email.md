Dear ,

Congratulations! After careful review of your application and qualifications, I am pleased to inform you that I've select you to join the Full Stack Craft team as a Full-Stack Engineer and Developer! Attached is the Independent Contractor Agreement outlining the terms and conditions of your engagement with us. Please review the document thoroughly. Note carefully the 'crunch time' areas - this is NOT me trying to scam you, this is me attempting to predict the future from my own experience (like having a server blow up or what not as we all know probably too well), and then once we're through the following weeks are easier :) 

Once signed and returned to me, we can get started right away!

I look forward to working with you and building great products together!

-Chris
