## [Hiring] Full-Stack Developer - Early Partner/Co-Builder (Remote, Long-term)

Trust me when I say, as a software engineer, I hate the hiring process probably as much as you do — but here goes - the whole gig:

I run a bootstrapped fintech & developer tools company (fullstackcraft.com) building multiple profitable products serving options traders, sports bettors, and developers alike. My current portfolio includes The Wheel Screener, LEAPS Screener, VannaCharm, PriceArb, CodeVideo, and several others — combined generating ~$3k/month with minimal expenses.

I’m at the point where my own hustle (next to a full time 'day job') is at its absolute max, and I need someone who wants to build alongside me, not just for me.

## What Makes This Different

Real equity in growth: I’m not hiring a “resource” — I’m looking for someone who thinks like an owner

Genuine partnership: You’ll have real input on product direction, tech decisions, and strategy

Multiple products = multiple learning curves: Never boring, always shipping

Bootstrapped & profitable: No VC pressure, no bullshit — just sustainable building

Your wins are my wins: As revenue grows, your compensation grows

## The Work
Build and maintain features across my fintech suite (options screeners, price arbitrage tools)

Work with: Golang + TypeScript React Next.js (90% of our newest stacks), sometimes Supabase (postgresql), Stripe integrations, serverless functions as needed

Ship fast, iterate faster — I validate with real users immediately

Eventually: mentor other devs as we scale (if that’s a path you want)

## You

Strong full-stack fundamentals (I can teach the specific stack, my philosophy behind building SaaS)

You’ve built side projects or genuinely want to understand the why behind features

Comfortable with ambiguity (in some cases - otherwise I have a seemingly neverending todo list) and you like wearing multiple hats

You want to see P&L numbers and understand the business

Based in South Asia (I'd like the benefit of timezone shift + I believe in fair global compensation)

## Compensation

Starting at $500/month for 50% full time equivalent work with a clear path to increase as products scale. This isn’t the ceiling — it’s a starting point. I’m revenue-sharing minded for the right partner.

## To Apply

Send an email to hi@fullstackcraft.com — tell me about something you built (side project, GitHub, whatever) and why you want to grow with a small bootstrapped operation instead of taking a comfortable corporate gig. I want to understand how you think.
